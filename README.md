# simplegui2pygamemodule
this module can be used to run simplegui files on python using pygame
step wise procedure:


1. copy and past your simplegui program in python IDLE
2. replace import simplegui with import simplegui2pygamemodule as simplegui
3. and run the code
warning - this module sometimes is causing problems with few games and another thing, use only time based movement that is using timer() in simplegui not directly update the position in draw methode else you game movement will increase sharply because execution speed of pygame is very high.
tips - if you use this module, you can run you game on python directly which makes it easy for packging in exe also by using some third party modules such as py2exe, pyinstaller, cx_freeze etc.
