# Pytable
Module to create table for python
we come across many times when, we just print the output directly. In that case this module can be useful. You can nicely present your input and output in form of a table for comparision.
So, you can get started with this module. Its preety easy and user friendly. you can understand the working of the module through help function on python.
And one more thing, this module can not be used to manage data but can be used as to present the data.
